# beer-reviews
This is a dataset of over 1.5 million reviews given for various beers. It includes overall review scores, ABV%, Name of beer, Name of brewery, and more specific review scores for beer features (aroma, appearance, taste, palette). 


## My responses and solutions to these questions can be found in the [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/elanperry/beer-reviews/blob/master/beer_reviews.ipynb).


#### 1.    Which brewery produces the strongest beers by ABV%?

#### 2.    Which of the factors (aroma, taste, appearance, palette) are most important in determining the overall quality of a beer?

#### 3.    I typically enjoy a beer due to its aroma and appearance, which beer style should I try?

#### 4.    If I typically enjoy Scottish Ales, what other beer style might I like?

#### 5.    Lastly, if you had to pick 3 beers to recommend using only this data, which would you pick?
